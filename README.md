## Development Test

Please prepare a .NET Core/C# Console application, which allows the user to interact with one of the following:

- Another human
- The application

To play a game of Rock Paper Scissors.

Once a game is complete you should output the following:

- The winner
- How many turns the game took
- Most used move during the game, either 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'

Please provide your submission to us via a Bitbucket or GitHub repository URL.

### Stretch Goals

(Pick one if there is time!)

- Write tests for your program using a suitable test framework (For example XUnit) or even practice Test Driven Development
- Extend the move list to include Lizard & Spock (see [http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html) for an explanation of the extra rules).
- Store the game history in a live database (SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB, CosmoDB etc)
